going with the tree struct was def way harder that the hash table.
For some reason my tree is being passed in NULL. I am pretty certain
that the tree is forming correctly, minus the first node being null,
but i would love to come to office hours to bust this assignment through
the rest of the way. Time to study for C quiz!

Your code was used for the read_word function. Wasnt sure where to cite that.
