Hi Professor. Not sure if you have already graded my final,
but I told you I would polish it up, and Ive worked and worked and worked
for just that! I know you said you cant grade it officially or accept it,
but I hope that I demonstrated to you my C abilities and I hope youve witnessed
my growth.

Through any creative testing I could come up with, I believe that the mush2
is fully functional if not close. Ive plugged leaks, handled file redirection,
corrected the plumbinig, as well as various other things. Ive ran all your
tests in the spec and have the same output (except for when you do "foo", and 
it says denied). 

Thank you for a great quarter, and thank you for being a great teacher!

Have a great summer.
