Thanks for a fun quarter Professor Nico. In this tough year, your morning 
sarcasm has brought me joy. If there's one thing I learned, it's to never 
code while people are watching! On a more serious note, I hope you can
 bear witness to the improvements I've made throughout the quarter. I 
will admit that hencode and mytar were a steep learning experience, but 
I feel that I was really able to shine on mytalk (favorite project i've done). 
I wish I had more time before Friday (...5 hours from now…) to polish up 
mush2, but I am very drained. For pete’s sake, my car broke down on 
Sunday 30 min out from CalPoly after a 3+ hour drive, and I had to get it 
towed. Been a whole ordeal but I digress. I have plans to make the shell a
 little more than minimally useful over the summer, as well as to expand 
mytalk, so I hope I can reach out here and there. Thank you Professor for
 all the time you’ve given me in office hours...hope you don't forget the 
BMW flag behind me!

Mush2 stuff while my brain is Mush:

Using ^C resets the shell
Using ^D will exit the shell

I'm missing a small piece of logic for the pipe direction
Also need to add the check for redirection and open() the file

Commands exec as expected though!
